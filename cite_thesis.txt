The sports network teaching platform based on the Internet of Thingsis directly oriented to the actual classroom teaching, collecting and storing real-time classroom data, which is a new change in the data acquisition of the original information-based assisted teaching mode. 4-6\nBased on the sensor technology of the Internet of Things, remote sensing technology can transform students or teachers in teaching activities into \u2018living points\u2019, which is equivalent to storing the process of movement in a digital way andpreparing data for future simulation, analysis and modelling. 7,8 This lays a data foundation for reproducing the actual teaching activity mode, and the transfor-mation of this mode is relative to the original teaching mode. The model is a new change. Dynamic self-feedback perfect system, using the data of teaching theory to build theoretical teaching reference model, using the dynamic data collected fromreal-time sports classroom teaching activities to build the model, will get the actualsports teaching model, and then compare the two models, will get the difference between the theory and the actual model, according to the difference, we can analyze the problem and guide the improvement. 9-11 Teaching activities, thus continuously self-feedback, iteration and improvement, will form the dynamicinteraction and feedback optimization of theoretical model and practical model. The data source of this dynamic model is collected by the Internet of Things, which is also the important significance of the Internet of Things and data modelling and simulation. From the actual teaching activities, evaluating the actual teachingactivities and improving the actual teaching activities, with the theoretical modeland the actual dynamic model, we can formulate a scientific and reasonableevaluation index system according to the actual situation, which can be used to guide and evaluate the teaching activities in each classroom, and even to carefully study the learning activities of each student, and grasp the important index data inthe teaching activities. 12,13 Speaking with the actual data and making improvement plans based on the actual data are very helpful to guide every student and every teaching activity.\n"

    "Combining multiple clustering methods based on core group": [
        "The algorithms for cluster ensembles consist of two main components. The first component is the method for generatingthe base clusterings (the individual clusterings in the ensemble), including the source of diversity (differences among the base clusterings). One possibility is to use different clusteringalgorithms for each base clustering. This is the approach in [9], where the goal is to identify \u201crobust\u201d clusters, each definedas a set of patterns that are in the same cluster in every baseclustering. When a single algorithm is employed to produceall the base clusterings, the most common choices includeexpectation maximization (EM), as in [10] and [11], andk-means, as in [12]-[14]. Both EM and k-means have the builtin source of diversity from different initializations and, as in [12], different numbers of clusters in the base clusterings. Otherpossible sources of diversity include different orderings of thepatterns for online clustering algorithms [15] and differentlinkage types for hierarchical agglomeration [16]. The differentsubsampling of data has been studied as well [17]. The relationbetween the degree of diversity and the quality of the combinedclustering is the subject of [18].\nFor this purpose, we introduce here the concept of core groups, defined as subsets of Xthat satisfy the following condition: Two patterns x iandxjbelong to the same core group if and only if \u03bbi=\u03bbj.

It is easy to understand that /bardbl\u039b/bardbl\u2264N. The number of core groups depends on the distribution of patterns, as well as the algorithms andparameters used to generate the base clusterings. The procedurefor identifying the core groups from the base clusterings isincluded in the next section. We note here that the concept ofcore groups has been previously mentioned in [16], althoughthe method there for identifying the core groups is very differentfrom ours and is only designed to work with a particular clusterensemble algorithm.\n"

The estimated values can be used to predict the moving object\u2019s future positions. For future predictions, most techniques use some mathematical formulas of motion derivedfrom recent movements. However, an object\u2019s movements are not simple. In this regard, recent studies have used objects\u2019 trajectory patterns for predicting their future positions. Jeung, Liu, Shen, and Zhou (2008) introduced a hybrid prediction model in which both mathematical formulas and trajectory patterns are considered.

        "For the use case with Smul TCan, we chose the netrin family of axon guidance molecules and their receptors from the DCC and UNC-5 families [21] since their involvement in cancer progression has gained recent attention. Netrins promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation; they are also involved in migration, invasion, and angio-genesis [22]. In a study of netrin mutation, expression, and methylation profiles across TCGA-PANCAN, several netrins were identified as potential diagnostic markers for endocrine tumors [23]. However, an approach focusing on multivariate, multi-cancer survival analysis remains unexplored with this gene family. The gene expression dataset of netrins and their receptors (netrins-receptors) consisted of the six netrins NTN 1, NTN 2, NTN 3, NTN 4, NTN 5, NTNG 1, and NTNG 2; the receptors of the UNC-5 family UNC 5 A, UNC 5 B, UNC 5 C, and UNC 5 D; and receptors DCC and DSCAM [21]. Altogether the dataset comprised twelve genes.\nFig. 6. Screenshot of the cumulative hazard plot of KIRC for DSS indicates distinct prognostic outcomes for low and high-risk sample groups. A. Ozhan et al. Computers in Biology and Medicine 137 (2021)1047938 findings indicated unique HR GSs for this gene set, especially in neural and renal cancers such as LGG and KIRC (see also Supplementary Fig. S 10). In addition, the best subsets of netrins-receptors identified with lasso could significantly differentiate between high-and low-risk prognostic outcomes. Given the role of netrins and their receptors in the nervous system as axon guidance molecules, their involvement in LGG is expectable. Our results with kidney cancers KIRP and KIRC seem to corroborate those by Hao et al. [23], who studied the impact of netrins on survival via methylation studies, e. g., for NTN 4 and NTNG 1. However, our unique multivariate approach also allows for understanding the proportional contribution of genes within the netrins-receptors gene set on survival. Therefore, the netrins-receptors and their best subsets can be analyzed further experimentally in renal cancers and LGG to determine their biological role in these disorders.\n"

Because the core research in 3 D model retrieval is feature extraction, the work of organizing 3 D model database is not much. However, most of the existing methods for organizing 3 D model database are based on traditional clustering algorithm. Meanwhile, they do not take new incremental models into account. For example, [8,9] focus on agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify 3 D models. The algorithm called ASCAR in [8] is developed based on CURE and a distance-based outlier detection, which can stop clustering automatically. CAOIC+Kmeans proposed in [9] makes use of outlier information and adopts the concept of core group to reduce the influence of parameters. However, the number of clusters still needs to be predefined. Based on above work, a platform with several traditional clustering technology is developed in [10]. But the clustering results are not very good.

Since the highest enrichment of essential genes was obser ved among the top 100 highest degree nodes, hubs (90%), largest number of kinless hubs (16 out of total 29) in PCa PPI network were also found among these top 100 hubs (Fig. 7). Therefore, the high degree nodes of PCa PPI network corresponded to majority of the kinless hubs and essential genes indicating their importance in the sustenance of the system and ultimately survival of the PCa cells [5,14]. Loss of such important kinless and connector hubs from the PCa PPI network corresponding to the essential gen es may induce a shift in the interactions between the proteins and ultimately disintegration of the functional/pathway modules rendering the PCa cells difficult to survive. Hence, kinless hubs are the most important hubs in PCa PPI network which could be p otential target candidates for development of drugs against PCa. Mutations in such modular hubs and dysregulation of their expressions could alter the interactions between proteins affecting the multi protein complex formations and signalling pathways dist urbing the dynamics of the system leading to tumour development in PCa and other related diseases [61].

        "With the advent of Web 2.0, new information technologies represen ted by service computing [1], cloud computing [2] and big data [3-5] have been developed rapidly. As a most technology in Service-oriented Architecture (SOA), Web services have also made great progress. Even though Web services published on the network is increasing gradually, these Web services are difficult to meet people's complex functional requirement. Web services are online application services published by organizations to perform certain functions and be designed online to support the interaction between interoperable machines on the network with low cost and high efficiency [6]. There are many Web service description languages, for example, WSDL [7], OWL-S [8], RESTful structured API services, and so on. It has become a challenge problem to immediately and exactly discover the user-desired Web services, and it also becomes more difficult for softwa re developers to discover and reuse service resources effectively. According to the survey, it is very essential to perform the management of Web services through the technologies of service discovery [9], service composition [10]. The classification of We b services with similar functionality is an important approach to support service management, which can extremely decrease the search time and the scope for Web services, thus promote\n",
        "Qo S parameters of a service composition is by dynamic service selection at run time [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. In a dynamic service composition a set of functionally equivalent services exists for each service invocation and actual services are incorporated into the execution configuration depending on their most recent Qo S parameters. However, two dominant issues limit the application of dynamic compositions on a larger scale: service selection and detection of equivalent services. Since service selection at run time is bonded by additional constraints, like statefullness and composability [7], statebased reliability models need to be applied. However, such models are prone to state explosions [14], making it difficult to support more complex compositions. The other commonly used approach treats service selection as an optimization problem. However, such optimization problems are complex [15], often NP-hard, which limits their use. Moreover, discovering and maintaining sets of functionally equivalent services, i. e. homogeneous service communities [8], [16], [15], also proves to be a nontrivial task [17], [18], [19].\n",

The article addresses the problem of how to discover web services community formed by closely interactive web services (zhang et al., 2009). They proposed a novel approach which constructs a web service execution network from logs and clustering it using spectrum clustering. Semantic link network (SLN) is a loosely coupled semantic data model for managing web resources. Its nodes can be any types of resources. Its edges can be any semantic relations (Zhuge, 2012). By studying the intrinsic relationship between semantic communities and the semantic space of SLN, approaches to discovering reasoning-constraint, rule-c onstraint, and classificationconstraint semantic communities are proposed (Zhuge, 2009). Approaches m ake use of the semantic communities and the emerging semantic relations in a dynamic complex network of learning resources to support effective learning.

Unfortunately, enumerating all maximum matchings is extremely expensive from a computational perspective\u2014a network with a couple dozen species has several hundred million unique max-imum matchings. To solve this problem, we employ a recently-de-veloped algorithm that reveals the control correlations between the nodes in the graph while requiring considerably less computational resources (Zhang, Lv, & Pu, 2016). Using this algorithm, we are able to identify species that are possible control inputs\u2014those that belong to the minimum driver-node set in at least one of the possible control configurations. Here, we extend this algorithm such that it is possible to calculate a highly accurate approximation of the control capacity \u03d5 of every species in the network (Supporting Information Section S 3.3). In the networks that contained reciprocal links (because there was no asymmetry in the dependences of a species pair), we averaged a species' control capacity \u03d5 across every possible \u201cnon-recip-rocal\u201d version of the network (Supporting Information Section S 3.4).\n",

When generating a minimum control configuration, it is the maximum matching that dictates the unmatched nodes that receive direct input at the base of the stems of the corresponding cacti (these nodes have often been called \u201cdrivers\u201d). Alternative minimum control configurations can be generated by sampling or enumerating alternative maximum matchings 4,5,12 or by using the notion of the input graph to find alternatives 9. Because this has largely been an approach based on sifting through the degeneracy, a number of studies have quantified the role that certain nodes and edges play in controlling the network. The DCS concept concisely explains these categories because DCSs are by definition mutually disjoint.\nInput graph. The input graph of a directed network is defined as an undirected graph with the same nodes and whose edges encode alternative driver nodes that make the directed network structurally controllable 9. It is built by connecting two nodes xi and xj in the input graph if there exists a node xk which has an edge (in the original network) to both xi and xj, where one node is matched and the other is not. Doing so requires effectively enumerating through the alternative matchings. The utility of this construction is that it identifies interchangeable driver nodes and with an extension identifies nodes that are never selected as driver nodes across all possible maximum matchings. cv=\u03c7v \u03c7=\u03c7D 1 \u03c7D 2... \u03c7 Di\u22121 \u03c7Di, v\u03c7Di+1... \u03c7 Dk \u03c7D 1 \u03c7D 2... \u03c7 Dk=\u03c7Di, v \u03c7Di, 9\n",

Another self-healing algorithm that bases the selection on a performance prediction scheme is proposed in [39].

Ghosh et al. [7] in their survey and synthesis of Self-Healing Systems (SHS) presents a classification of existing work. The outcome of this survey is that the structure of SHS is quite modular (classification with respect to failure detection, system recovery and maintenance of health). SHS are based on different paradigms of computational models such as architectural models, repair plans, agentbased models. So, the opportunity and inspiration to develop systems based on new sources is substantial. Since there is a high demand for new sources, we sought to establish a novel methodology for modeling SHS based on the formal speci-fication by predicate logic of a given system. Therefore, we present in this section the related literature based on existing formal methods for modeling multi-disciplinary systems like the smart grid and self-healing approaches based on formal specification.\n",

        "The technique in [5] uses dynamic description logic (DDL) to describe the preconditions and effects of web services. The DDL-described preconditions and effects are transferred into diagnosing processes embedded in a BPEL execution environment. When a web service is executing and a diagnosing process identifies mismatched predictions or effects, the web service will be isolated for path healing. The technique in [11] proposes a heuristic algorithm to evaluate whether the remaining resources (e. g., time and budget) are sufficient for the un-finished sub-path. If the answer is negative, the unfinished sub-path should be re-planned. The technique in [2] predicts seven types of web service failures and proposes solutions to recovery the failures. The recovery solutions are embedded in the BPEL execution environment. The tech-nique in [12] uses semi-Markov model to predict the performance of an executing web service. If the predicted performance failed to fulfill the Qo S criteria, the re-planning process is initiated. In this case, the re-planning process and the web service path are executed simultaneously, which reduce the time of re-planning. The tech-nique in [3] proposes that the failure of an executing web service may cause other executing ones to fail because more than one close related web service of a path may be executed in parallel. It uses direct compensation dependency (DCD) and indirect compensation dependency (ICD) to identify the scope of web services affected by a failure. It then reselects web services to replaces those within the scope. The reselec-tion should offer the least compensation. The technique in [4] belongs to the WS-DIAMOND project [13]. It proposes a Qo S-driven, connector-based proactive healing 672 S.-C. Chou and C.-Y. Chiang architecture. Connectors can intercept the message sent to a web service and add Qo S requirements to the message. After the execution of a web service, the Qo S values are recorded in a log. The diagnostic engine periodically checks the log. When a possible violation of Qo S criteria is detected, the technique initiates a re-configuration me-chanism to self-heal the web service path. The technique in [14] compares the exact Qo S values with the estimated ones. When a loop of web services is executing, the exact Qo S values of the web services are used to evaluate whether the loop may vi-olate the Qo S-based SLAs. If the answer is positive, the technique uses an algorithm to identify the path slice (i. e. sub-path) that should be re-planned. The technique in [15] defines the scope of failed web service and embeds the scope in BPEL. When failure occurs, the BPEL engine initiates the healing process for the scope, which selects new web services to replace the failed ones. During the selection, the local and global business rules are used to filter out infeasible web services. 3 TLPRP TLPRP is depicted in Figure 1.

For example, in aneconomic network, we may only aim to control a certaingroup of individuals who are essential to our task, rather than controlling all the individuals. Therefore, the control of a prescribed subset of each layer is motivated. This problemis termed target controllability of multiplex networks. To the best of our knowledge, target controllability of multi-plex networks remains largely an outstanding challenge facedin various real-world applications in the areas of biology, chemical engineering, and economic networks [29]. Although target controllability of single layer networks has been studied [29]-[34], the results are hard to be extended to multiplex networks. This is because in multiplex networks, the controlleris usually limited to interact with only one layer, while the target controllability of nodes in other layers also has to be guaranteed.\n",
        "Traditionally, we assume that the topological structure remains static and then study its influence on the net-work dynamics 1-6. However, the topological structure is not necessarily static. One of the relatively new research themes is how dynamic processes affect on the evolution of topological structures. In particular, the controlla-bility of a complex network, which we assess by determining whether the network can be driven from any initial state to any desired state within a finite time, is considered one of the focal research subjects and has been studied massively. Liu et al. convert the problem on structural controllability into a graph maximum matching problem 6 and propose the scheme of calculating the number of minimum driver nodes. Yuan et al. later expand the results to undirected networks 7 and propose the exact controllability theory. Y an et al. analyse the observational uncer-tainty and the energy required for control and achieve a series of fundamental yet important theories 8. Prof\u00e1i applies structural controllability to temporal networks 9. Additionally, Gu et al. study the application of network controllability to brain networks 10. These problems address how to control the whole system efficiently. However, for certain large systems, we only need to control some target nodes of the network that are associated with spe-cific tasks. Thus, Gao put forward an approximate algorithm to calculate the fewest driver nodes that can be used to control the target nodes, which effectively reduces the usage of driver nodes 11. Zhang et al. make improvements to this algorithm 12. The above theory pertains to the dynamic process on the nodes.\n",

In the process of target control, some nodes besides the targets might be unwillingly controlled. Actually, one often needs to have some mediator nodes between the drivers and targets. The mediators are also controlled by the drivers, and the smaller the number of the mediators is, the fewer the unwillingly controlling actions will be. In many cases, it is important to reduce the side effects through ensuring that the network states are transferred to the desired states by minimizing the number of the mediators. In this manuscript, we aim to present a computationally efficient algorithm for target control, which will make sure that the number of the mediators is kept minimal. The proposed algorithm is based on the length of paths between the nodes and meets the Kalman's controllability rank condi-tion Thus, it does not have the restrictions of the structural controll-ability. Structural controllability is when matrices are structural, i. e. their elements are either fixed zeros or independent free parameters.\n",

Target controllability and actuator selection for target control are addressed using structural analysis in many papers. A greedy algorithm is proposed in [2] to find an approximate solution to the minimum input selection for target control. Note that, though [2] applied the greedy algorithm on various real-time systems, it does not provide any theoretical guarantee for the performance of the algorithm.

Instead of using the greedy algorithm, Zhang et al. [52] developed an algorithm which elaborately rearranges the matching order of the nodes such that the required number of steering nodes for target control can be significantly reduced. The comparison results on model generated networks and real networks indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms Gao et al. \u2019s algorithm [39]. Because the functions of network systems intensively depend ontheconnectionsbetweennodes, Liu et al.

In the study, the relationships between the number ofsteering nodes for controlling giant connected components and the parameters of model generated networks are explored. Piao et al.

The user Qo S value orientation, often with a certain personality preferences, therefore, the selection of services not only to meet the objective accuracy of the information service quality, but also reflects the subjective preferences of multiple users, for example, some users want to give priority to the response time, while some users will want to give priority to the implementation cost of such inspection, and so on. In this case, under multi-user collaborative environment, a Web Service selection process, in essence, is a multi-objective decision making process with multi-user participated. For these complex, collaborative context application environments, to conduct dynamic service selection based on multi-objective decision making in a multi-user environment is an important research trends. \u2022 Service selection support personalization. Together with the user preferences with the Qo S into service selection process, give full consideration to the user\u2019s personalization, such service selection algorithm, is still a future research priorities, which will broaden the scope of application of the algorithm. \u2022 Reliable service selection considering the dynamic changes of Qo S. On the one hand, conducting dynamically Qo S prediction, on the other hand, improving the robustness, stability, reliability and other aspects of performance of composite service combining the research of selection algorithm that during the operation the combined service should have fault tolerance ability and failure recovery ability. Now more and more scholars introduced the trusted computing research results to the service computing. \u2022 Service-correlation aware service selection. In the actual Web application scenario, the service Qo S may have a correlation with other service [31,33]. Therefore, the research on service-correlation aware service selection method is highly targeted and practical. \u2022 New mixed selection algorithms. Currently, the service selection algorithm use of hybrid selection strategy is still relatively small. Learning the merits of multiple algorithms to conduct algorithm fusion is an important way to improve the performance of service selection algorithm, there is still much work to do.\n",

        "Over the past few years there has been a resurgence of interest in the question of structural controllability posedby Lin in 1974 [1]. As defined by Lin, a pair of matrices (A n\u00d7n, bn\u00d71) with each entry either a fixed zero or a distinct scalar parameter is structurally controllable if there is a real matrix pair (\u00afAn\u00d7n, \u00afbn\u00d71) with the same pattern of zero entries as (A, b) which is controllable. Thus if (A, b) is structurally controllable, then almost every real matrix pair (\u00afA, \u00afb) with the same pattern of zero entries as (A, b) will be controllable. Lin was able to give an explicit graphtheoretic condition for such a matrix pair to be structurallycontrollable in terms of properties of a suitably defined directed graph determined by the given matrix pair. Lin\u2019s resultwas extended to multi-input matrix pairs (A n\u00d7n, Bn\u00d7m) in linear algebra terms by Shields and Pearson [2] andreexplained in graph theory terms by Mayeda [3].

Sev-eral techniques were used to perform this further analysis: an algorithm to enumerate all maximum matchings of a net-work (Uno 1997), preferential matching algorithm (Zhang et al. 2014) and \u201call possible input nodes\u201d algorithm (Zhang et al. 2017). The enumeration algorithm is so far the only one capable of enumerating all the MSDNs along with the corresponding maximum matching. Conversely, the \u201call pos-sible input nodes\u201d algorithm is much faster and can provide alternative nodes for each node in an MSDN, while it does not provide the corresponding maximum matchings. Since enumerating all possible maximum matchings is computa-tionally expensive, the preferential matching algorithm was applied to the NIO 1 case as follows (Antoni et al. 2018): the algorithm can build different maximum matchings based on the preferences expressed as inputs. By varying the input preferences, the algorithm can be used iteratively to find different maximum matchings. The results obtained with the preferential matching algorithm were compared with the results of the enumeration algorithm and of the \u201call possible input nodes\u201d algorithm. The latter two methods cannot han-dle self-loops (that is, a node pointing directly to, and thus influencing, itself), but it can be shown that removing self-loops from the network does not change its controllability (Zhao et al. 2015). Remarkably, all of the three techniques show a good accordance in predicting the distribution of driver nodes among the network, which corroborates the analysis of NIO 1 network.\n",

        "Lam et al proposed three ML algorithms able to predict the results of 2%/2 mm gamma passing rates obtained with portal dosimetry for IMRT QA. The authors observed a prediction accuracy of these algorithms ranging from 95% and 98% [187]. Li et al proposed a ML architecture consisting of a Poisson Lasso (PL) regression model that predicts the individual gamma passing rate, followed by a RF classification model that classifies the QA result as \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d. The system was reported to have reliable results once the original data was pre-processed to compensate for the original tendency of PL model in overestimating the gamma passing rates of challenging VMAT plans [188]. As discussed, these ML approaches also have the advantage of interpretability and they allow to discriminate the features that have the highest impact on the results. On the other side, these models have low portability as they are highly dependent on different factors that are institution-dependent, such as the systems used for pre-treatment verification, the evaluation methodology chosen and the treatment unit. DL methods have also been proposed to extract features from the dataset that can be used to model and classify pre-treatment verification results [189-192]. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the integration of DL and radiomics could have great potential in the growth of automation in QA, as reported by a recent experience by Nyflot et al, which demonstrated that a DL model can detect the presence of treatment delivery errors from the radiomic analysis of patient-specific QA dose maps. In the future, it is reasonable to expect that thanks to the support of modern AI-based systems it will be possible to automate QA procedures in MRg RT as well, so reducing the time needed for plan specific verifications without compromising safety and quality of online adaptive procedures.\n",
        "Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can be used to evaluate the ability of IVD systems to correctly classify observed dose deviations and to determine optimal action limits [77]. ROC analysis, however, requires a statistically significant size of error and no-error samples as input. The experimental acquisition of EPID measurements to produce such samples is typically a cumbersome process, which ex-plains why there are only a few studies on the topic in the IVD literature [78-81]. Recently, use has been made of synthetic EPID images to eliminate the need for phantom error introduction and positioning [82]. Another alternative is to model possible errors by introducing modifications in the TPS [83]. Vendors, in collaboration with the clinical community, are requested to promote research activities related to the error detectability of their IVD systems and to facilitate colla-boration within a user group. Additional research is also required to investigate the use of alternative measurement analysis techniques, e. g., use of exploratory data analysis, radiomics, and/or machine learning [84-86]. 5.4.

        "As described above, the plan complexity features affect delivery accuracy. Regarding the plan complexity features, the MLC aperture-based features such as the AA was associated with plan complexity and impacts on prediction accuracy. The dosiomics features categorized by GLCM, GLDM, and GLRLM have a large impact on predictions of the GPR value, so the effects of these dosiomics features were observed for plan complexity. Many researchers have reported that AA and leaf speed are crucial factors in\ufb02uencing the GPR prediction for VMAT [8-10,19,21], and several others have reported that the texture feature calculated by GLCM was the indi-cator of the complexity of dose distributions [11-13]. In this study, we have confirmed that AA, GLCM and GLDM were also important factors that feature in the prediction model. Moreover, the effect of disease site parameter was also important to classify GPR action level. The disease site parameter was identified as an important feature of the plan and dosiomics features at c 2%/2 mm. Classification performance would be affected if the dataset included many disease sites. In other words, it is indicated that plan complexity would depend on disease sites as well as plan and dosiomics features.\n",

In intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), gamma analysis is usually used to analyze the difference between the TPS-outputed and the actually measured dose distribution to evaluate the degree of dose deviation caused by various reasons during the execution of the plan, further to determine whether a plan is to execute based on the evaluation. However, previous studies have shown that different dose quality assurance (QA) system (dose QA system refers to the collection of measurement and analysis software and hardware used to ensure that the radiation dose is achieved at the target volume and the OARs as expected) have different abilities to detect errors based on the dose distribution output by TPS.\n",

        "Observer Placement for Source Localization: The Effect of Budgets and Transmission Variance Brunella Spinelli, L. Elisa Celis, Patrick Thiran Abstract\u2014 When an epidemic spreads in a network, a keyquestion is where was itssource, i. e., the node that started theepidemic. If we know the time at which various nodes wereinfected, we can attempt to use this information in order toidentify the source. However, maintainingobservernodes thatcan provide their infection time may be costly, and we may haveabudgetkon the number of observer nodes we can maintain. Moreover, some nodes are more informative than others due totheir location in the network. Hence, a pertinent question arises: Which nodes should we select as observers in order to maximizethe probability that we can accurately identify the source? Inspired by the simple setting in which the node-to-nodedelays in the transmission of the epidemic are deterministic, we develop a principled approach for addressing the problemeven when transmission delays are random. We show that theoptimal observer-placement differs depending on thevarianceof the transmission delays and propose approaches in bothlow-and high-variance settings. We validate our methods bycomparing them against state-of-the-art observer-placementsand show that, in both settings, our approach identifies thesource with higher accuracy. I. INTRODUCTIONRegardless of whether a network comprises computers, individuals or cities, in many applications we want to detectwhenever any anomalous or malicious activity spreads acrossthe network and, in particular, where the activity originated. 1 We call the spread of such activity anepidemicand theoriginator thesource. Clearly, monitoring all nodes is not feasible due to cost andoverhead constraints: The number of nodes in the networkmay be prohibitively large and some of them may be unableor unwilling to provide information about their state. Thus, studies have focused on how to estimate the source basedon information from a few nodes (calledobservers). Givena set of observers, many models and estimators for sourcelocalization have been developed [26], [21], [32]. However, theselectionof observers has not yet received a satisfac-tory answer: Most of state-of-the-art methods are based oncommon centrality heuristics (e. g., degree-or betweenness-centrality) or on more advanced heuristic approaches thatdo not directly optimize source localization (see [32] for asurvey) or are limited to simple networks such as trees (e. g., [16]). Moreover, such methods consider only the structureof the network when placing observers. However, dependingon the particular epidemic, the expected transmission delaybetween two nodes, and its variance, can differ widely. Weshow that different transmission models require differentobserver placements: This is illustrated in Figure 1: As thevariance of the transmission delays changes, the optimal set 1 In effect, we wish to answer questions such aswhat was the origin of aworm in a computer network?, who was the instigator of a false rumor ina social network? andcan we identify patient zero of a virulent disease? of observers also changes (see also Figure 2 for a concreteexample).\n",

        "The present paper is devoted to the estimation of the parameters and states in the complex networks with identical nodes being the chaotic systems. This estimation is provided by using an adaptive observer as well. Different types of observers can be used for the state or/and parameter estimations of the parameters of the systems [22]-[27]. For example, the decentralized observers for a network system, consisting of interconnected identical linear subsystems are presented in [28]. In [29], the distributed tracking problem for complex dynamical networks with nonlinear dynamics is investigated. In [30], the several placement strategies of the observers based on the centralities of nodes of the complex networks were analyzed. Synchronization and parameter identification of a unidirectional star-network constructed by discrete spatiotemporal chaos systems with unknown parameters are studied in [31] and adaptive integral sliding mode control design method for parameter identification and hybrid synchronization of chaotic systems connected in a ring topology is studied in [32]. [33] investigates the identification of unknown system parameters and network topologies in an uncertain fractional-order complex network with time delays (including coupling delay and node delay).\n",

(2016)) but is consistently less effectivethan K-Mediansandthanourmethods.\nTransmission delays. Many transmission models for epidemics have been studied (Lelarge 2009) and considered for source localization. Although discrete-time transmissiondelaysarecommon (Luoetal. 2014; Prakashetal. 2012; Altarellietal. 2014), inorder to better approximate realistic settings, much work (including ours) adopt continuoustimemodelswithvaryingdistributionsforthetransmissiondelays; e. g., exponential (Shah and Zaman 2011; Luo and Tay 2012) or Gaussian (Pinto et al. 2012; Louni and Subbalakshmi 2014; Louni et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2016). In the same line of the latter class of works, weuse truncated Gaussianvariables, whichgivesustheadvantageofensuringthat infectiondelaysarestrictlypositive.\nThe problem of minimizing the number of observers required to detect the precise source (asopposedto maximizing theperformancegivena budgetofobservers) hasbeen considered in the zero-variance setting.

Withoutassuming a tree topology and a known starting time, approximation algorithms have been developed towards this end (Chen et al. 2014) (still in a zero-variance setting). However, in a network of size n, the number of observers required, even if minimized, can be up ton\u22121, hence, a budgeted setting is practically more interesting. For trees, the budgeted placement of observers was solved by using techniques different from ours (Celis et al. 2015).

        "Many dynamical systems are studied in the context of network reconstruction [8] [9]. Methods which are based on phase synchronization [11], Lyapunov 45 exponent [12] [13] [14], feedback control [15] [16] and compressed sensing theory (CST) [18] [19] have been developed previously to reconstruct the underlying networks [20] [21]. Reconstruction of the network structure using phase oscillator is based on deterministically known coupling strength and nodal dynamics in advance [10]. Later, the authors considered some uncertainty as an improve-50 ment and modified the procedure for network reconstruction accordingly [11]. CST is used to reconstruct the interaction pattern of a network of coupled oscillators and games from time series data [22] [23] [24] [25]. Further, CST is also used to uncover the interaction pattern of nodes in a network given that the time series has only binary data [26].

        "Network diffusion is used to model spreading of different phenomena over networks, such as virus propagation in human populations and information diffusion in social networks. The point in the network where the diffusion originated, such as the first infected individual or a blogger who initiated a rumor is denoted as the source node and in order to curb the infection or prevent further malicious activity, it is crucial to identify it [1-6]. The source can be localized by observing the time stamps when nodes in the network became first infected (informed). Due to network size, limited resources and privacy issues, the infection times cannot be observed for all the nodes [2,3,6,7]. As the choice of observed nodes impacts the accuracy of source localization, how to select the most informative ones is an important question.\n"

In doing so, we address the open problem of a utomatic optimization of weights previous researchers have put forth (Huang et al., 2014).

        "Social network analysis (SNA) is an approach to discovering aspects of a specific networked structure consisting of nodes and edges. In addition, the development status/trends of such a network can be visualized, or forecast, by the SNA method [18-21]. The methodology defines a network where each participant is a node (or vertices), and each node in the network has a relationship (i. e., an edge), e. g., through conjunctions, with other nodes. Furthermore, knowledge transfer phenomenon can be discovered through SNA methodology [22]: researchers and organizations can use the information to boost research-and-development programs and to increase trans-or intra-organization cooperation opportunities [23]. Different centrality measures can also be used to investigate the \u2018player role\u2019 of each node with patent citation data [24-27]. SNA can not only lead to an under-standing of the technological invention status, but also can forecast future development trends, [28,29].

They discovered that important companies occupy the most critical position and are more influential than others in the network. Additionally, \u2019 betweenness\u2019 is another centrality measure to indicate the number of times a node locates in-between other nodes on the shortest path. The betweenness centrality can be used to assess the bridging role of one node among others, and is seen as an indicator of the influences flowing around the system [30].\n",

The distinctive feature of our approach is the identification of four structural roles based on the combination of two structural measures, and thus, it is not merely focused on node popularity.\nWhile high correlations among measures can be used to identify obviously important network nodes (e. g., Huang et al.

In [21], similarity measures are used to effectively measure how close two composite schemes are. In [22], a correlation and dot-patternbased approach is proposed to select services. In [23], the recurring patterns in a composition process are mined using an approach according to these execution logs.\n",
        "In early stage of the service computing research, a service pattern is regarded as a high-level abstract template such that it can be instantiated to different forms [16]. Subsequently, it is realised that the frequently-occurring segments in historical service solutions are likely to appear in the follow-up ones, thus mining patterns from history by data mining techniques becomes a dominating approach [17]. Hu et al. define the reusable logic in the business processes as the patterns, which can be shared among users to facilitate the construction of new service solution [18]. Zhang et al. extract the repeated 450 process fragments in the service \ufb02ow to expect service reuse in new solution construction [19]. In [20], frequent process fragments appeared in the service composition (including a set of frequently co-occurring services and the control \ufb02ows among these services) are extracted to prepare for the followup service composition be requisitioned by using data mining technique. Huang et al. further utilise fragment service process for composite service selection including control \ufb02ow and bound services [21]. However, it is important to figure out how to reuse these diverse frequent fragments at the right time. So, we need to analyse the distribution of service requests.\n",
        "There are two types of service pattern mining methods: top-down and bottom-up. The former identifies patterns from service process models, and the latter does from service execution logs. Both try to automatically find out repetitive process segments, identify structurally and functionally similar segments, and then combine them as patterns in a higher level of abstraction [10]. Data mining approaches such as sequential pattern mining or frequent itemset mining are popular methods for this issue [8] [9].\n",
        "Given the dataset of previously proposed scientific workflows, it can always find out some frequently occurred frag-ment patterns from history and then based on these patterns make service composition in the future. A great number of service composition approaches based on this idea areproposed and proved to be very successful. These frequentpattern usually give rules that summarize the relationships of correlations, collaborations, and complements between services in historical compositions. Original research on\u201cpatterns\u201d emphasized on the \u201cabstraction\u201d characteristic with the objective of \u201creuse\u201d [9]. Developers write patterns in terms of high-level functionalities and decide onthe function signature they want to associate to a functionality appearing in a pattern [10]. Hu et al. define the reusable logic in the business processes as the patterns, which can be shared among users to facilitate the construc-tion of new service solution [11]. In [12], frequent process fragments appeared in the service composition (including a set of frequently co-occurring services and the controlflows among these services) are extracted to prepare for the follow-up service composition be requisitioned by using data mining technique. In developing service-oriented appli-cations, similarly, a service pattern is defined as a set of services that are repetitively used together in various applications and records the best practices [13]. Zhang et al. extract the repeated process fragments in the service flowto expect service reuse in new solution construction [22].\n",
        "Currently, scientific work\ufb02ows are publicly accessible on the repository, which have been uploaded by scientists in many different domains (ranging from life science to textanalytics or astronomy). Considering the fact that developinga novel scientific work\ufb02ow from scratch is typically aknowledge-and effort-intensive, and error-prone mission, reusing and repurposing mature best-practices which have been evidenced by legacy scientific work\ufb02ows in the repos-itory is considered as a cost-effective and error-avoidingstrategy [1], [2]. Frequently-occurring fragments in legacyscientific work\ufb02ows are likely to appear in the follow-upones, thus, the pattern mining work from history becomes adominating approach [3], [4], [5]. Understanding the usagepatterns of services can facilitate the creation of service com-positions. Inspired by experimental functionalities, a novelscientific experiment may be satisfied by the composition of (i) fragments that correspond to general functionalities, and (ii) other fragments that are personalized somehow, in thedomain. It can be seen that each requirement is representedin the format of a function-oriented, personalized way, anda service pattern does not exist independently but has tobe bundled with specific functionalities. Thus, service com-position study upon patterns should not focus on frequentservice fragments only. Discovering functional patterns withdifferent types and characteristics is an appropriate wayto implement personalized requirements. Unfortunately, inmost state-of-the-art approaches, researchers seldom focuson mining works of different pattern types. To address thisproblem, this paper proposes a novel work\ufb02ow fragmentdiscovery mechanism considering basic and personalizedpatterns. The contribution of this paper is as follows: \u2022We present the discovery strategy of basic patterns. Fragments with similar content are assumed to solvesimilar functionalities and abstracted as basic patterns. \u2022We present the discovery strategy of personalized pat-terns. Through the work\ufb02ow clustering, personalizedfragments are discovered from clusters and assumed aspersonalized patterns under respective contents. \u2022Given a requirement in the format of the work\ufb02ow, wedesign a novel work\ufb02ow fragment discovery strategy. II. B ASIC PA TTERN DISCOVERY\nAs the number of available Web services and scientific work\ufb02ows is rapidly increasing, the discovery of relevantservices and work\ufb02ow fragments from massive candidatesdemands a lot of effort [1], [2]. Frequent pattern-basedcomposition approaches receive a great deal of attention. In [3], frequent fragments that appeared in the composition areextracted to prepare for the follow-up service composition. In developing service-oriented applications, a pattern isdefined as a set of services that are repetitively used togetherin various applications and records the best practices [4]. Huang et al. further utilize the service process for composite service selection including control \ufb02ow and bound services [5]. However, requirements are usually showed as a function-oriented way with specific demands. Thus, service compo-sition studies upon patterns should not focus on frequentsolutions only. In this paper, we aim to discoveries of basicand personalized patterns, and leverage them to compositethe optimal solution fragments for requirements. VIII. C ONCLUSION\n"
